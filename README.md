# BrainTumorDetectionAndClassification

## Objective:
To develop a robust and efficient brain tumor detection system using medical imaging techniques. 
The system will be trained on a large dataset of brain MRIs, both with and without tumors, to accurately identify the presence and location of tumors.

## Methodology
01 Collecting the dataset from different sources,
which will be selected by the amount of data I have
access to, as well as the quality of data.

02 The data will be processed, and made into a format with
which detection can be easily performed.

03 CNN for working with the image dataset
that is processed, and the appropriate neural
network will be trained on this data. The testing and
validation dataset will be helpful in determining the
accuracy and reliability of the particular model.

CNN:
1)	Apply convolution filter to first layer
2)	Reduce filter sensitivity by smoothing convolution filter (i.e.) subsampling
3)	Signal transmission from one layer to another is controlled by the activation layer
4)	Each neuron in the subsequent layer is coupled to the neurons in the preceding layer.
5)	Each neuron in the subsequent layer is coupled to the neurons in the preceding layer.

04 Analysing the data, visualizing it to provide a
better insight into the distribution , and also other
functions, which will provide more information on the
data, and the analytics of the output from the model.
